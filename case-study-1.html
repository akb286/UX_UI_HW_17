<!-- PROBLEM SECTION--> 

<div class="problem-section-summary">
  <h2>Summary</h2><p>NWACS focus is on empowering individuals with a communication deficit, by connecting them with technology and other tools that allow them to use their voice in alternative ways. A full redesign was created in Figma.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Role: UI/UX Designer: </strong>  Group member. Equally divided work on all aspects of this project including user research, prototyping, wireframes, UI Style Guide, slide deck, and presentation.</li>
    <li><strong>Skills/Technologies Used:</strong> user research (interviews & surveys) and analysis; mobile user experience design (UX/UI); interaction design; wireframing; prototyping; in-person user testing; Figma; and Canva.</li>
  </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="column-text">
      <p>The current NWACS site has decent overall content organization, but users struggle to locate specific content due to poor content chunking, excessive text, and lack of visual balance.  Users have to spend the majority of their time scanning through bodies of text to find the information they are looking for and can easily miss their target if they aren’t focused enough or aren’t scanning for the correct words.</br>

      </br>Scanning huge bodies of texts takes more time than having symbols, images, and key headings that are automatically recognized.  This extra work can prove frustrating for users and can even lead them to abandon the task altogether--as one of our users did.</br>
        
    </br>Additionally, the current visual design aims to be simple and straight forward, but the bold red and white color scheme is loud, further adds to the overall sameness of information and makes it difficult to identify key information.</p>

<!-- DESIGN PROCESS -->
<section class="problem-section">
  <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <div class="text-only">
      <p>Research for evaluating the functionality, intuitiveness, and design of NWACS.info included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Primary User testing</li>
        <li>Heuristic Evaluations</li>
        <li>Mid-fidelity 5-second user testing</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="text-with-image">
        <img src="images/menu-mobile-nav.png" alt="Hero 3 Steps" style="width: 70%;">
      </div>
      <p>The main Heusristic Evaluation takeaways included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Search bar lacks readily recognizable iconography and graphics</li>
        <li>Side Menu is overly complicated and adds to visual noise.</li>
        <li>Second set of social links is redundant.</li>
        <li>Button styles and links are inconsistent in format and click ability.</li>
        <li>Events Calendar has similar visual priority for all events including the “biggest event of the year.”</li>
        <li>The calendar also lacks consistent formatting in the bottom row of cards.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>To make the page feel light and airy, transparent images and graphics were used when possible. It was a high priority to ensure the brand’s scarlet color had the most impact and was still approachable; to do this the color was used in minimalistic organic shapes and lines.</br>
        
    </br>The wireframes started with opaque shapes, these were later adjusted to transparent line objects which allowed visibility of under layers and creates a light pass-through feeling. The finished prototype is easy to navigate, puts important information front and center, and is a visually pleasant experience.</p>
